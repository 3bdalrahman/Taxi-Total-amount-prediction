# Taxi-Total-amount-prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict NYC taxi fares from trip data. After cleaning and feature engineering, it implements various models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to predict total fare amounts based on trip distance, duration, and time features. Models are evaluated using RMSE and RÂ² metrics.
